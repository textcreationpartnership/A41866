1. GREAT And Good NEWS to the CHURCH OF ENGLAND: Being the Exact NUMBERS of CHURCH-MEN, DISSENTERS, And ROMANS, In ENGLAND And WALES;

    _ ☞Note, Here follows Four moſt Remarkable Providences, Worthy the Conſideration of every true Son of the Church of England, which import that God Almighty of His infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs has frequently given his People peculiar Tokens to diſtinguiſh Good from Evil; more eſpecially in diſpoſing Matters ſo Agreeable to the Leſſons, Epiſtles, and Colects for theſe following Days which have been Attended with ſuch Extraordinary Circumſtances:

      * That on the 30th of January, when King Charles I. of Bleſſed Memory, was Murthered, the Leſſon appointed by the Church to be Read on that Fatal Day, is the 27th Chapter of St. Matthew.

      * That it was on the 8th day of June, That the Biſhops were Committed to the Tower; immediately they went to Evening Service to the Chappel. The Second Leſſon for the Day, Appointed by the Church, is the 6th Chapter of the 11 Epiſtle to the Corinthians.

      * That it was upon the 29th of June, St. Peter's Day, that they were Delivered; They went immediately to White-Hall Chappel, the ſame Morning, to Return Thanks, Where the Epiſtle for the Day was Read, in the 12th Chap. of the Acts, from Verſe the 1ſt. to the 12th.

      * When Oliver the Ʋſurper died, which was on the 3 of September, 1658. The Leſſon appointed by the Church for that Day, is the 14th Chapter of Iſaiah, from Verſe 5. to 21.
